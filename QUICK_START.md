# üéØ Quick Start Guide - Already Have Schema

Since you've already added the SQL schema, here's what you need to do NOW:

## ‚úÖ What You Have:
- Storage bucket "documents" created ‚úÖ
- SQL schema already executed ‚úÖ
- Application built and ready ‚úÖ

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE STEPS:

### Step 1: Verify Your Setup (Optional but Recommended)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to check everything:
```sql
File: D:\finscore-analyser\sql\verify_setup.sql
```

This will show you:
- ‚úÖ Which tables exist
- ‚úÖ RLS status
- ‚úÖ Policies configured
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket status

### Step 2: Add Storage Policies (REQUIRED!)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
File: D:\finscore-analyser\sql\storage_policies.sql
```

**Why?** This secures your file uploads so users can only access their own files.

### Step 3: Test Your Application

Your dev server should already be running. Visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

If not running:
```bash
cd D:\finscore-analyser
npm run dev
```

## üß™ TEST FLOW:

### 1. Sign Up New User
- Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: Test@123456
- Click "Sign up"

### 2. Should Auto-Redirect to Dashboard
- URL: http://localhost:3000/analyst-dashboard
- Should see: Dashboard with zeros (new user)
- Should see: Your name or email in header

### 3. Create First Analysis
- Click "New Analysis" button (top right or in dashboard)
- **Step 1**: Fill form
  - Report Name: "Test Report"
  - Reference ID: "TEST-001"
  - Analysis Type: "Bank Statement Analysis"
  - Click "Next"
- **Step 2**: Upload files
  - Drag and drop or click to select
  - Can use any PDF for testing
  - Click "Next"
- **Step 3**: Review and confirm
  - Check details
  - Click "Start Analysis"

### 4. Check My Reports
- Click "My Reports" in sidebar
- Should see your new analysis
- Status: "processing" or "pending"

### 5. Test Navigation
- Click each sidebar link:
  - ‚úÖ Dashboard
  - ‚úÖ My Reports  
  - ‚úÖ Profile
  - ‚úÖ Subscription
  - ‚úÖ Security
- Click "Logout" ‚Üí Should redirect to /login

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You See Errors:

### "Table does not exist"
**Solution**: Run `sql/safe_setup.sql` (safe to run, won't drop existing data)

### "Storage policy error" or "Unauthorized" on upload
**Solution**: Run `sql/storage_policies.sql` immediately!

### "Failed to fetch" errors
**Check**:
1. Is Supabase URL correct in `.env.local`?
2. Is your Supabase project active?
3. Are you logged in?

### Dashboard shows no data
**This is CORRECT for new users!**
- New users start with zeros
- Data appears after creating analyses

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

### New User Dashboard:
```
Total Analyses: 0
This Month: 0  
Processing Queue: 0
Recent Activities: Empty state
```

**This is GENUINE, not fake data!**

### After Creating 1 Analysis:
```
Total Analyses: 1
This Month: 1
Processing Queue: 1 (if status is "processing")
Recent Activities: "Uploaded X files for analysis"
```

## üéØ YOUR APPLICATION IS READY IF:

- [x] You can sign up new users
- [x] Login redirects to dashboard
- [x] Dashboard shows zeros for new users
- [x] "New Analysis" button opens modal
- [x] Can upload files (Step 2 of wizard)
- [x] Jobs appear in "My Reports" page
- [x] Logout works and redirects to login
- [x] Sidebar navigation works

## üöß WHAT TO BUILD NEXT:

The infrastructure is complete. You need:

1. **PDF Parser** - Extract text from bank statements
2. **Analysis Logic** - Calculate income, expenses, risk
3. **Report Generator** - Create PDF reports from results

**Location**: `src/lib/parsing/` and `src/lib/analysis/`

## üìû QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING:

Run this query in Supabase to check table status:
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Should show:
- analysis_jobs ‚úÖ
- bank_accounts ‚úÖ
- documents ‚úÖ
- subscriptions ‚úÖ
- transactions ‚úÖ
- user_activities ‚úÖ
- user_dashboard_stats ‚úÖ
- security_logs ‚úÖ

## üéâ YOU'RE READY!

Just run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000
