## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (DO THIS NOW!)

### Step 1: Execute Main Database Schema

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. **Open file**: `D:\finscore-analyser\sql\complete_schema.sql`
3. **Copy ALL content** (entire file)
4. **Paste in SQL Editor**
5. **Click "RUN"**
6. **Verify success messages appear**

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ FinScore Analyzer schema created successfully!
üìä Tables created: 8
üîê RLS policies: Enabled on all tables
‚ö° Indexes: Created for performance
üéØ Triggers: User stats auto-update enabled
```

### Step 2: Set Up Storage Policies

1. **In Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Open file**: `D:\finscore-analyser\sql\storage_policies.sql`
3. **Copy and paste**
4. **Click "RUN"**
5. **Verify policies created**

This ensures users can only access their own uploaded files!

### Step 3: Start Your Application

```bash
cd D:\finscore-analyser
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Complete Flow

1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Sign Up**: Create a new account
3. **Auto-redirect**: Should go to `/analyst-dashboard`
4. **Check Dashboard**: Should show zeros (new user)
5. **Click "New Analysis"**: 3-step wizard appears
6. **Fill Step 1**: 
   - Report Name: "Test Analysis"
   - Reference ID: "TEST-001"
   - Analysis Type: "Bank Statement Analysis"
7. **Upload Step 2**: 
   - Upload a PDF file (can be any PDF for testing)
   - Add password if protected
8. **Review Step 3**: Confirm and start analysis
9. **Check "My Reports"**: Should show your new analysis job

## üìä DATABASE TABLES OVERVIEW

Once you execute the schema, you'll have these tables:

| Table | Purpose | Records for New User |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `analysis_jobs` | Track all analysis requests | 0 initially |
| `documents` | Store uploaded file metadata | 0 initially |
| `bank_accounts` | Extracted bank account info | 0 initially |
| `transactions` | Individual transactions | 0 initially |
| `user_dashboard_stats` | Dashboard metrics | 1 (auto-created) |
| `user_activities` | Activity log | 0 initially |
| `subscriptions` | User plans | 0 initially |
| `security_logs` | Security events | 0 initially |

**Note**: The `user_dashboard_stats` table automatically creates a record for each new user via trigger!

---

## üîê SECURITY FEATURES ENABLED

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ‚úÖ Users can only see their own data
- ‚úÖ Automatic user_id filtering on all queries
- ‚úÖ No data leakage between users

### Storage Security
- ‚úÖ Files organized by user_id/job_id
- ‚úÖ Private bucket (not publicly accessible)
- ‚è≥ Policies need to be added (Step 2 above)

### API Security
- ‚úÖ Session validation on every request
- ‚úÖ User_id verification
- ‚úÖ Error handling with proper status codes

---

## üìÅ FILE UPLOAD FLOW

When a user uploads documents:

```
1. User selects files in AdvancedFileUpload component
2. Files sent to /api/v1/analysis/bank-statement
3. API creates record in analysis_jobs table
4. Files uploaded to Supabase Storage: documents/{userId}/{jobId}/{filename}
5. Metadata saved in documents table
6. Activity logged in user_activities table
7. User stats updated automatically (trigger)
8. User sees job in My Reports page
```

---

## üé® DASHBOARD DATA FLOW

### Real User Data (Not Fake!)

**Dashboard Statistics**:
- Total Analyses: From `user_dashboard_stats.total_analyses`
- This Month: From `user_dashboard_stats.this_month`
- Processing Queue: Count of jobs with status='processing'
- Recent Activities: From `user_activities` + `analysis_jobs`

**My Reports Page**:
- Lists all jobs from `analysis_jobs` table
- Filtered by current user's ID
- Shows real-time status (pending/processing/completed/failed)

**New User Experience**:
- Dashboard shows zeros (genuine, not fake)
- Empty state with "Create Your First Report" CTA
- Stats increment as user creates analyses

---

## üåü WHAT MAKES THIS PRODUCTION-READY

### 1. **Clean Architecture**
- Proper separation of concerns
- API-first design
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout

### 2. **Real-Time Data**
- No mock data anywhere
- Direct database integration
- Automatic stats updates via triggers

### 3. **User Experience**
- Professional 3-step wizard
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Empty states with clear guidance
- Error messages with actionable info

### 4. **Scalability**
- API routes can be serverless functions
- Database optimized with indexes
- File storage separate from database
- Activity logging for analytics

### 5. **Security First**
- RLS on all tables
- Session-based authentication
- User-specific file access
- Activity tracking for compliance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Storage Bucket Configuration

I can see your documents bucket is created. **Make sure**:
1. ‚úÖ It's set to **Private** (not public) - CORRECT in your screenshot!
2. ‚è≥ Execute the storage policies (Step 2 above)
3. ‚è≥ Test file upload after policies are added

### Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` is configured correctly:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gnhuwhfxotmfkvongowp.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

‚úÖ This is good to go!

## üöß WHAT YOU STILL NEED TO BUILD

The infrastructure is 100% complete. You need to implement:

### 1. **Bank Statement Parser** (High Priority)
**Location**: `src/lib/parsing/`

Parse PDF statements from Indian banks:
- Extract transactions (date, description, debit, credit, balance)
- Detect bank name and account number
- Handle password-protected PDFs
- Support major banks: SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Axis, Kotak, etc.

### 2. **Analysis Engine** (High Priority)
**Location**: `src/lib/analysis/`

Calculate financial metrics:
- Total income and expenses
- Category-wise breakdown
- Cash flow patterns
- Anomaly detection (unusual transactions)
- Risk scoring
- Trend analysis

### 3. **Report Generation** (Medium Priority)
**Location**: `src/lib/reportPdf.ts`

Convert analysis results to PDF:
- Executive summary
- Charts and graphs
- Detailed transaction breakdown
- Risk assessment
- Recommendations

### 4. **Email Notifications** (Low Priority)

Send alerts when:
- Analysis completes
- Job fails
- Report is ready

```
1. Go to /signup
2. Enter email/password
3. Submit form

3. Step 2: Upload PDF (any PDF for testing)
4. Step 3: Review and confirm
5. Should see upload progress
6. Redirects to My Reports
7. New job appears with status "processing"
```

5. Subscription ‚Üí Sidebar link works
6. Logout ‚Üí Clears session, redirects to /login
```

## üìû TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: "Unauthorized" errors
**Solution**:
