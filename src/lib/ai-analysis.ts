    Generate a concise executive summary based on the following financial analysis data:

    Overall Summary:
    - Total Income: $${summary.total_income.toFixed(2)}
    - Total Expenses: $${summary.total_expenses.toFixed(2)}
    - Net Cash Flow: $${summary.net_cash_flow.toFixed(2)}

    Red Alerts:
    ${redAlerts.length > 0 ? redAlerts.map(alert => `- ${alert.type}: ${alert.description}`).join('\n    ') : 'None'}

    Monthly Cash Flow Trends (last 3 months):
    ${monthlySummaries.slice(-3).map(m => `- ${m.month}: Income $${m.income.toFixed(2)}, Expenses $${m.expenses.toFixed(2)}, Net $${m.net_cash_flow.toFixed(2)}`).join('\n    ')}

    Risk Assessment:
    - Score: ${riskAssessment.score}
    - Details: ${riskAssessment.details}

    Key Counterparties (Top 3 by amount):
    ${counterparties.slice(0, 3).map(c => `- ${c.name}: $${c.total_amount.toFixed(2)} (${c.total_transactions} transactions)`).join('\n    ')}

    Based on this data, provide a high-level executive summary, highlighting key financial health indicators, significant trends, and any major risks or opportunities.
    The summary should be professional, objective, and no more than 200 words.
