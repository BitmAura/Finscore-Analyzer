## 📊 What You Should See

### **After Creating 1 Analysis:**

**Dashboard Stats Update:**

- This Month: **1** ✅
- Processing Queue: **1** ✅
- Recent Activities: "Uploaded X files for analysis" ✅

**My Reports Page:**
- **1 job listed** in table
- Shows status, date, and details

---

## 🎯 File Upload Verification

To verify storage policies are working:

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to Storage → documents bucket
   - You should see folders: `{userId}/{jobId}/{filename}`
   - Files are organized by user ID

2. **Check Database**:
   - Go to Supabase → Table Editor
   - Check `analysis_jobs` table → Should have 1 row
   - Check `documents` table → Should have 1 row
   - Check `user_activities` table → Should have 1 row

---

## 🚨 If You See Any Errors

### **"Failed to fetch" error**
**Solution**: 
- Check if dev server is running
- Restart: `npm run dev`
- Check `.env.local` has correct Supabase URL

### **"Storage error" or "Policy violation"**
**Solution**: 
- Verify policies were added successfully
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Storage → documents → Policies
- Should see policies listed

### **"Table does not exist"**
**Solution**: 
- Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
- Run the verification query:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_name;
```
- Should show 8 tables

### **Upload succeeds but can't see files**
**Solution**: 
- This is expected! The backend analysis processing isn't implemented yet
- Files ARE uploaded to storage
- Job status will stay "processing" until you implement the parser
