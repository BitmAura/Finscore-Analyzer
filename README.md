## Supabase Setup

FinScore Analyzer now uses Supabase as the backend (PostgreSQL managed by Supabase).

### Quick Start (Development)

1) Environment - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   # Server-side only (do not expose on client)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-strong-secret
   ```

2) Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3) That's it — all database access is handled by Supabase. Use the Supabase Dashboard → SQL editor or migrations to manage your schema.

### Production Deployment

- Host the Next.js app on your preferred platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or Node server)
- Configure the same Supabase env vars in your hosting provider
- Manage database schema and policies from the Supabase Dashboard
